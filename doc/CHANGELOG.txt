v0.1.1, 12/10/2024:

* Fixed a bunch of things that were broken for generating Visual Studio project files after removing our dependency to Core.
* VisualStudioSolution::path is now relative to the source file that implements set_visual_studio_options, as the documentation says.

----------------------------------------------------------------

v0.1.0, 11/10/2024:

* Add set_builder_options( BuilderOptions* ), which lets you customize your builds how you want via C++.
* Add --nuke command line argument that will delete all the contents of a folder, followed by the folder itself.
* Add --config=<config> command line argument which lets you specify your own configs.
	* BuilderOptions::config gets set to this, so you can use it to configure your builds based off config.
* Add on_pre_build( BuilderOptions* ) and on_post_build( BuilderOptions* ), which run just before and just after your build, respectively.
* Add Visual Studio Solution and Project generation.
	* This is done by using the entry point set_visual_studio_options( VisualStudioOptions* ).
* Expose all optimisation levels that Clang provides via BuilderOptions, instead of just a boolean toggling them on/off.
* Detect if a specific version of Clang is installed.  If it's not, then download and install it automatically.
	* This doesn't override any pre-existing version of Clang, nor does this set any environment variables.
* Set default output path to the same folder as the source file you are building.
* Set default binary name to the same as the source file except the file ends with .exe instead of .cpp.
* Remove Clang-specific syntax from defines, additional_includes, additional_lib_paths, and additional_libs in BuilderOptions.
	* Can't remove it from the ignore_warnings just yet.  That list probably needs to be moved into a Clang-specific set of options.
