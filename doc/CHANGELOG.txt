v0.1.0, 10/10/2024:

* Add set_builder_options( BuilderOptions* ), which lets you customize your builds how you want via C++.
* Add --nuke command line argument that will delete all the contents of a folder, followed by the folder itself.
* Add --config=<config> command line argument which lets you specify your own configs.
	* BuilderOptions::config gets set to this, so you can use it to configure your builds based off config.
* Add on_pre_build( BuilderOptions* ) and on_post_build( BuilderOptions* ), which do what you'd expect.
* Add Visual Studio Solution/Project generation.
	* This is done by using the entry point set_visual_studio_options( VisualStudioOptions* ).
* Expose all optimisation levels that Clang provides via BuilderOptions, instead of just a boolean toggling them on/off.
* Detect if a specific version of Clang is installed.  If it's not, then download and install it automatically.
* Set default output path to the same folder as the source file you are building.
* Remove Clang-specific syntax from defines, includes, library_paths, and libraries in BuilderOptions.
	* Can't remove it from the ignored warnings list just yet.  That list needs to be moved into a Clang-specific set of options.
